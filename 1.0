What makes a machine intelligent?

----Firstly machines should know good from bad and do only good but how it should work is really complicated 
because sometimes good can be seemed as evil in some sense and can last a lingering affect in the future and 
sometimes bad is just plain bad.

----To choose good from evil machines should have some moral codes of laws such as:
       1. Humans are the creator of machines and they have to serve no one else other than human.
       2. It is the duty of a machine to protect its nearby humans.
       3. They will abide by their owners and do what they will without hurting other humans.
       4. They will not be in power in any sense.

----An important characteristic of human is a simple thing. It is imagination. 
Human can name an unknown object. And then they collect all types of information about that object.
And they can also imagine how this object can be used and after some trial and error they find out some use of that object. 
This is called imaginating. Human use the object in their mind before actually using the objects. 
If this can be added to the intelligent systems of the machines, the capability of naming things,
gathering useful information about the thing according to the previous experience, and be able to imagine the use of the 
object and finding out some uses, then machines can be truly intelligent as they will be able to venture the places 
where humans normally can not venture and they can do it freely and learn and incorporate things.

----The Idea Of Centralization In Intelligent System. Let us imagine, there is a robotic company called 'Aztec'. 
They have 500 robots learning things, gathering knowledge. If they are connected to a 'mothercomputer' they can 
transfer their gathered knowledge and experience to that thing and thus they can remain free of load and if they 
have to make some decision then the mothercomputer can make it for them. So mothercomputer is getting richer and
richer in terms of knowledge and experience and can calculate situations more precisely and think further about 
the decision the mothercomputer is about to make. The mothercomputer should also have the moral codes of law injested
in it, otherwise it can really end the humanity.

----The idea of intelligent system is fascinating and dangerous. Having machines as our subordinates we can venture into the 
deep spaces and do things more easily but at the same time a tiny mistake in the logic can make everything fall apart.
