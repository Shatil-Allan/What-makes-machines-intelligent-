# What-makes-machines-intelligent-

An important characteristic of human is a simple thing. It is imagination. 
Human can name an unknown object. And then they collect all types of information about that object.
And they can also imagine how this object can be used and after some trial and error they find out some use of that object. 
This is called imaginating. Human use the object in their mind before actually using the objects. 
If this can be added to the intelligent systems of the machines, the capability of naming things,
gathering useful information about the thing according to the previous experience, and be able to imagine the use of the 
object and finding out some uses, then machines can be truly intelligent as they will be able to venture the places 
where humans normally can not venture and they can do it freely and learn and incorporate things.
